# Sara7aFront

This project is dynamic and responsive on all devices, I have used nodeJS and Angular to create this project and it has the following features.

The first page is home and this page contains some info about me.
The register page is for registration and creating a new account.
After login, you will go to the profile and find all the hidden messages that have been sent to you and no one can know the sender.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
